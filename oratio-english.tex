\rubric{Prayer}

\rubric{\Vbar\ }The Lord be with you.

\rubric{\Rbar\ }And with thy spirit.

Let us pray.

O God, Who by the leading of a star didst, as on this day, manifest thine Only-begotten Son to the Gentiles, mercifully grant that we, which know thee now by faith, may after this life have the fruition of thy glorious Godhead: Through the same Jesus Christ, thy Son, Our Lord, Who liveth and reigneth with thee in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, world without end. \rubric{\Rbar\ } Amen.

\rubric{\Vbar\ }The Lord be with you.

\rubric{\Rbar\ }And with thy spirit.
